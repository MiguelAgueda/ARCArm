The four MG 996R servo motors that are giving movement to the robotic arm need
6 volts (V) and up to 2.5 amperes (A) each. Free spinning current is the the current drawn when the
motors are spinning at full speed with no resistance.
The free spinning current can get to as low as 500 milliamperes(mA). To drive all four motors
simultaneously and freely a 2A current will be required. So far, I have been able to drive
up to three motors at the simultaneously, under load, with only 1A of current at 5V.


Next, a 11.1V, 2200mA, lithuim polymer battery will be used to drive the arm.
Using a lipo for a project like this is required because the arm will
eventually be attached to a remote control or autonomous vehicle where it
will need to have a seperate power supply.
